## Insight 1: Churn by Contract Type

The chart above shows how customer churn changes based on contract length.

### Explainable AI (What this means for the business) ðŸ¤–

This is a major business insight. Our **month-to-month** customers are leaving at a very high rateâ€”nearly half of them. This tells us they don't feel committed to our service. In contrast, our **two-year** contract customers are extremely loyal, with almost no churn. This is a call to action to create incentives for short-term customers to sign a longer contract.

## Insight 2: Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)

This chart compares the average monthly revenue from customers who left versus those who stayed.

### Explainable AI (What the business should do) ðŸ’¡

This finding is both surprising and important. We're losing our **highest-value customers**â€”the ones who spend the most each month. This means we can't just focus on acquiring new customers; we must prioritize the retention of our premium users. We should consider launching a dedicated customer success program or special perks for our high-spending clients to ensure they feel valued and stay with us.
